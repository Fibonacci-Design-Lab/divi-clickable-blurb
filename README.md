# divi-clickable-blurb

This adds a new module to your Divi Library called Clickable Blurb that will make your entire blurb clickable. It's moves the href to a "wrapper" around the entire Blurb div. Like all of my custom modules, the clickable_blurb.php file should go into a file called custom modules in your child theme.
